* Since we're dealing with Microservices architecture, I recommend to restructure the whole project so 
    every service will have its own sub-project.
    I suggest the following structure:

    - alerts_handler
        requirements.txt
        conf.ini
        src:
            - init.py
            - logic.py
    - alerts_monitor
        requirements.txt
        conf.ini
        src
            - init.py
            - logic.py

    etc...

* All hardcoded values throughout the code should be configured externally via ENV VAR or in the config.ini
    Example:
        - URLs
        - Time consts
        - file names
        etc.
