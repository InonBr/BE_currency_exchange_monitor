```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

2. run Docker file
```
docker-compose up -d
```

docker-compose down
```

4. List working Docker containers
```
sudo docker ps
```

## Test the app

**Make sure Docker containers are running!**

2. Run all python files in a separate terminal: 
```
   - python3 data_processor_service.py
   - python3 alerts_monitor_service.py 
   - python3 alerts_handler_service.py
